2024-01-14T17:24:45,2024-01-14T17:24:45," Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. Are you ready to practice speaking in English with me? Let's do it. What do you do? Where do you want to go? What's up to this weekend? Ooh, could you answer these questions in English? In today's English lesson, you will practice speaking with me about seven of the most common conversation topics in English. We will practice vocabulary, questions, sample conversation, plus you will have the chance to have a sample conversation, practice conversation with me too. Over the past year, I have made seven Speak With Me lessons, and today I have combined them all in a very useful lesson where you can practice them for the next two hours. To help you never forget what you've learned, I've created a gigantic free PDF worksheet using all of the vocabulary, phrases, questions, sample sentences, and some challenge questions so that you can never forget what you've learned. You can download this free PDF worksheet with the link in the description. All right, are you ready to get started? We're going to be talking about these topics today. So drum roll, let's get started with the first one, weekend plans. Are you ready to learn the most important conversation question of all time, at least according to me? Is that question, what's your name? No. Is that question, will you give me money? No. Is that question, do you love me? No, no, no. The most important conversation question is, there's actually two parts, what about you? How about you? When someone asks you about your weekend plans and you say a little reply, I'm going hiking, I'm not doing much, there might be an incredibly awful, awkward pause. What happens next? Well, this is where the most important question comes in. You can ask them, what about you? How about you? You can kind of imagine tossing a ball back and forth. The other person has asked you a question, what are you doing this weekend? They throw you the ball. Now you reply and you say, okay, I'm going hiking or I'm not doing much. You need to throw or toss.",73.91974472999573,"In today's English lesson, you will practice speaking with me about seven of the most common conversation topics in English.

Nelle ultime settimane ho pensato molto a come fare un video di conversazione che fosse in qualche modo un video interattivo. Mi sono incuriosita questa idea perché giro vagando su YouTube ho visto altre persone che parlano di lingua estraniere che insegnano lingua estraniere fare questo tipo di video. Però poi con il passare dei giorni, con l'arrivo delle vacanze, di Natale ho lasciato un po' perdere questa idea. Quindi voi vi starete chiedendo e perché adesso hai deciso di fare questo video se avevi lasciato perdere questa idea? Perché qualche giorno fa ho ricevuto su Instagram un messaggio da uno studente che mi ha scritto per suggerirmi di fare un video così. Mandando mi anche il link ad un video del canale English Fluency Journey che ovviamente sono andata a guardare anche per un po' di ispirazione. Perciò eccomi qui oggi a fare questo video con voi, spero che questa idea vi piaccia ma sicuramente mi farete sapere che cosa ne pensate qui sotto nei commenti. Che cosa facciamo in questo video? Proviamo a conversare sulla base di un breve dialogo che ho scritto e che voi vedrete sullo schermo. In questo breve dialogo ho cercato di riprodurre il più fedelmente possibile il parlato informale di una conversazione tipo tra due persone che si conoscono.",49.4309139251709,tutti e bentornati sul mio canale oppure benvenuti se questo è il primo video che guardate qui sul mio canale.
