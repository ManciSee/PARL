This project constitutes my bachelor's thesis in Computer Science at the University of Catania. "PARL" is an innovative solution aimed at enhancing the experience of speakers and listeners through real-time Speech to Text and advanced analysis of audio files. Implemented on a containerized distributed architecture with Docker, the platform leverages open-source technologies such as Kafka, Spark, Fluent Bit, Elasticsearch, and Kibana to optimize the process.

"PARL" offers advanced features, including real-time Speech to Text with high accuracy, Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, and Text Summarization. Targeted at a diverse audience, including professionals in the audiovisual industry, journalists, academic researchers, and businesses, the project promises to significantly improve the experience by utilizing stream processing tools. These tools enable real-time processing of audio signals and the execution of operations for text comprehension and analysis, opening new opportunities for semantic and sentiment analysis in the field of information and communication.
