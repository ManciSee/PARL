This project constitutes my bachelor's thesis in Computer Science at the University of Catania. "PARL" is an innovative solution aimed at enhancing the experience of speakers and listeners through real-time Speech to Text and advanced analysis of audio files. Implemented on a containerized distributed architecture with Docker, the platform leverages open-source technologies such as Kafka, Spark, Fluent Bit, Elasticsearch, and Kibana to optimize the process.

"PARL" offers advanced features, including real-time Speech to Text with high accuracy, Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, and Text Summarization. Targeted at a diverse audience, including professionals in the audiovisual industry, journalists, academic researchers, and businesses, the project promises to significantly improve the experience by utilizing stream processing tools. These tools enable real-time processing of audio signals and the execution of operations for text comprehension and analysis, opening new opportunities for semantic and sentiment analysis in the field of information and communication.
## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How to use
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManciSee/PARL.git
cd folder_name
```
2. Install the requirements that are inside the ```transcript``` folder

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Build and run the docker container
 ```bash
cd folder_name
docker compose-up -d
```
5. Run the Flask server
```bash
cd transcript
python3 transcript.py
```
6. Open the server on the port ```8880```
7. Start the recording or upload the WAV file
8. Enjoy!
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer 
If the ```docker compose``` doesn't work, run the container in this order:
1. Zookeper
2. Kafka
3. Fluent Bit
4. Elasticsearch
5. Spark
6. Kibana

If your browser doesn't support the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition), change the browser... Unfortunately at the moment only Google Chrome (not Brave or other) seems to be working at its best.

After downloading the repository, before being able to start everything, it is necessary to change the various ports and IP addresses of the server. In some files, sections of code for localhost have been commented.
